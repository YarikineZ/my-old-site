All my scientific activities took place from 2017 to 2020 during my master's degree at Skoltech. I devoted this time to the study of composites, namely, the mathematical simulating of the resin polymerization process.

During the time of writing my dissertation, I published 3 articles:
1. Effect of Additives on Cure Kinetics of Pultrusion Resins
2. Mathematical simulation the kinetics of polymerization of vinyl ester resin using in pultrusion
3. Effects of additives on the cure kinetics of vinyl ester pultrusion resins

Articles are available [here](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?hl=en&user=7QUp3gcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=title) and [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yaroslav-Nasonov). The full text of the dissertation is ~~[here]~~ will be added soon.

The main task of the research is to refine the existing mathematical models describing the thermodynamics of Vinyl ester curing. Also I've paid an attention of the effect of technological additives on the polymerization process. Better understanding of the curing process leads to composites production optimization and the absence of defects.
