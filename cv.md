# Some facts
The most inquisitive person in the world.

1. I did not enter Skoltech the first time, but graduated with honors.
2. Launched a microcomputer into space.
3. I stopped teaching because I felt that the students would become stronger than me.
4. I replaced the cloakroom attendant at the High School of Economict with a robot.
5. I made several tech startups and realized how technologies can change the world around us.

In addition to soft skills, I'm advanced in technology. I program in Python, C++. I use databases (Redis, MongoDB, SQL (Postgres). In development, I use Git, Docker containers. I know computer vision (OpenCV) and machine learning (Yandex Catboost, XGBoost). I have knowledge in statistical analysis and econometrics. Also experience in developing IoT devices.

A comprehensive understanding of how technology works together with business has allowed me to become a product owner in a corporation.
